# HonorsThesis

	The site is divided in multiple pages using both HTML and PHP and a connection to an SQL database through Microsoft Azure and Bitnami.  It is currently live at http://104.210.45.14/view.php ; however, this will not be live for long (only until June 2020). 
	This site is a tool to be used by computer science professors to create exams for their classes. They will be able to search the database of questions, delete any questions that they don't want, or create any new ones through another page. Once, they have selected the questions that they want by adding them to their shopping cart, they can access the shopping cart page to view all of the questions and make any slight edits to the order of them. From here, an exam title and instructions can be input which will appear on the document once it is converted to a pdf. Hitting the 'PDF' button will download a pdf version of the exam onto their machine.
